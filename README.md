# HighGFlocculation
# Spring 2018 Team Goals/Objectives 
Overarching Goal: Optimizing Flocculation!! :O
1. Evaluate whether hydrophobic tubing may mitigate headloss issues: Our tests indicate that hydrophobic tubing does not alleviate headloss. 
2. Evaluate whether headloss can be mitigated by running pump at full speed for a short time (approx.30 seconds). 
3. Determine an optimal G value.
4. Conduct experiments to determine a relationship between coagulant dose and optimal G.
