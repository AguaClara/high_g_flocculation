## Abstract
Previously, the High G team designed an experimental setup to test the effects of velocity gradient (G) on flocculator performance. Specifically the team sought to determine an optimal G value through effluent turbidity results.

For this semester, the team aspires to continue to conduct experiments to determine an optimal G value. Additionally, the team seeks to evaluate the use of hydrophobic tubing to minimize headloss, assess whether headloss can be mitigated through a sudden, short increase in pump speed, and to determine a relationship between coagulant dose and optimal G. As of now, the team has concluded that hydrophobic tubing does not significantly mitigate headloss.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Make sure to first refer to the team as the "High G Flocculation team (High G team)" to introduce shortened name.

Try to minimize use to "has" and "to" i.e. "the team aspires to continue" could be "the team will continue" (more concise) and "the team has concluded that" is equivalent to "the team concluded that".

If possible, minimize what previous teams did in the first paragraph and instead include your hypothesis.

## Introduction
Flocculation is a critical component of  the water treatment process in which particles, which have had their charges neutralized through coagulation, are prompted to collide and aggregate with other particles to form flocs. The intention is that once these flocs conglomerate, they will settle out due to gravity during sedimentation. A driving factor in the formation of these flocs is from particle shear in the flocculator. For High G's specific experimental setup, flocs are solely composed of clay particles and coagulant (PACl). A fraction of the surface of the clay particles is covered in coagulant and when these particles are prompted to collide, a successful collision occurs due to electrostatic attraction: the positively charged coagulant particle neutralizes the negatively charged clay particle. The likelihood of such collisions to occur increases when particles scatter around at different velocities, hence a flocculator subjects flow to a specific velocity gradient.

Last semester, High G Flocculation worked on experimentally determining the ideal G value for flocculator performance by varying G and residence time values through the flocculator while keeping all other variables in the setup constant. An overarching goal for this semester is to continue to determine an optimal G value and model a relationship between coagulant dose and optimal G. However, a continuous issue is the pressure build up in the flocculator. To mitigate this, the team this semester seeks to evaluate hydrophobic tubing as a potential solution to pressure buildup.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
In your abstract, you say the team has already determined the effects of hydrophobic tubing - use consistent tenses.
</div>

Although AguaClara plants consistently meet drinking water standards  for  Honduras,  they  do  not  consistently  meet  US  EPA  standards,  thus  improvements in plant design that produce predictable reductions in effluent turbidity will bring the team closer to fulfilling clean water needs in various countries including the US. In addition, the optimization of channel size, baffle number, and baffle size can reduce the use of unnecessary material. Additionally, alleviating the pressure build up observed in the experimental apparatus will allow for better experimental design and research.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
What does consistent mean here? Is consistent like 50% of the time? 60%? Try to use a more accurate word.

Will AguaClara technology be used in the US?

So you are varying two variables and I am assuming you are also doing the experiments as a function of time. Do you expect two different trends or do they connect? Remember your audience

## Literature Review and Previous Work

The product of velocity gradient, G, and residence time has been used as a parameter for designing flocculators for many decades.  The product of these two terms, is often referred to as the collision potential. Various other parameters have been shown to affect flocculation since then, including coagulant dose, volume fraction and attachment effciency, O'Melia (1972); Kawamura (1991). The High G Flocculation team has attempted to isolate the velocity gradient and residence time as variables affecting flocculation while controlling for all other variables.  Based on recommendations from Monroe Weber-Shirk, the collision potential is maintained constant at around 20000, since an increase in G corresponded with a reduction in residence time.

What is a hydraulic flocculator vs a flocculator (jargon?)
</div>

It  is  unclear  whether  floc  formation  in  a  hydraulic flocculator  is dominated  by  inertial  forces,  ie.turbulence,  or viscous shear (Pennock et al., 2016).  The experimental setup designed by the High G Flocculation  team  only  produces
flow  with  Reynolds  numbers  (Re)  less  than  2000,  meaning  that  the effect of turbulence is not observed in these experiments.  The team could thus isolate the effect of G, i.e.  viscous shear on the process of flocculation.

Theoretically, it is unclear how changing G might affect the performance of the flocculator in terms of effluent turbidity.  It is necessary that flocs be large enough to be captured during the sedimentation process. However, there is evidence that small flocs do not combine with big flocs, although the exact mechanism for this is not clear (Swetland et al., 2014).  Research has shown that to an extent, a high G value will produce flocs that are smaller and more dense (Carissimi et al., 2007),allowing them to combine more effectively with other flocs.

Paragraph is a little confusing towards the end.

"However, there is evidence that small flocs do not combine with big flocs, although the exact mechanism for this is not clear" - what is the mechanism?

Last semester, the High G team measured the pressure increase through the flocculator of one trial at 300 Hz and 1.4 mg/L coagulant.

**Figure 1: Graph of Pressure Difference vs. Time from Fall 2017**

The pressure throughout the flocculator increased about 12 cm in 10 hours. The change in effluent turbidity throughout did not change. Prior research from the High Rate Sedimentation team (Galantino, Zarecor, Gonzalez. 2017)  has indicated that at higher upflow velocity in the sedimentation tank, the floc blanket will decay and the effluent turbidity increases throughout a similar experimental trial, likely from the gradual increase in pressure in the flocculator.

**Figure 2: Graph of Effluent Turbidity vs. Time from Fall 2017**

The above graph shows a decrease in removal efficiency with time in the High Rate Sedimentation team's experiment at 3 mm/s upflow velocity in the sedimentation tank.  The higher upflow velocity shows a more pronounced difference in removal efficiency compared to High G Flocculation's Fall 2017 experiment where removal efficiency did not decline with time using a sedimentation tank upflow velocity of 2 mm/s.

The High G Flocculation team hypothesizes that coagulant buildup in the flocculator is the main contributor towards the observed increase in pressure different throughout the flocculator and is currently researching methods to mitigate that pressure increase.

# Methods

### Experimental Apparatus
This section will briefly describe key components of the team's experimental apparatus and explain their purpose. A more detailed description of the governing design calculations, ProCoDA variables and set points, and experimental setup can be found in the Manual available at the end of this report.
###The High G Setup
![ExperimentalApparatus](https://github.com/AguaClara/high_g_flocculation/blob/master/ExperimentalApparatus.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 3: High G Experimental Apparatus**

As shown in Figure 3 above, the overall experimental setup consists of a flocculator, clay and coagulant reservoirs, tube settler, and five distinct pumps. For this semester, two different flocculator tubing were used: hydrophobic and regular tubing. Regular tubing is depicted in Figure 1 above. Tabulated below is a summary of the experimental materials and their respective functions.

![ApparatusMaterials](https://github.com/MehrinSelimgir/Personal_MS/blob/master/EquipmentFunctions.PNG?raw=true)

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Proofread - wrong figure number
Use parallel sentence structure when writing lists.
</div>

###Key Components
Flocculator design parameters were determined through Python calculations(detailed in the Manual section) and sedimentation design parameters were based on values derived from the High Rate Sedimentation Summer 2017 team. Furthermore, influent turbidity, coagulant dose, and residence time within the sedimentation tank were pre-established by all the Particle Removal subteams. A summary of these values are tabulated below.

![Flocparameter](https://github.com/MehrinSelimgir/Personal_MS/blob/master/FlocculatorParameters.PNG?raw=true)

A pressure sensor, circled in red in Figure 4 below, is incorporated into our experimental setup (located at the inlet and outlet of the flocculator) to assess whether the water and flocculator pumps are maintaining constant pressure during each trail.

![pressuresensor](https://github.com/MehrinSelimgir/Personal_MS/blob/master/pressuresensor.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 4: Close-up of the Pressure Sensor**

Additionally, a pressure attenuator (denoted in Figure 1) is incorporated into our setup (located between the water pump and influent turbidimeter), to mitigate the large pressure release to the flocculator from each perstaltic water pump rotation.



It is important to note that a waste stream between the flocculator and tube settler is also incorporated into the experimental setup. The intention of this waste stream is to fluctuate flow rate between the flocculator and the sedimentation tank to allow varying G values in the flocculator while maintaining a constant upflow velocity in the sedimentation tank.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Define what a pressure attentuator does

What are the implications of the waste stream? I understand the purpose, but why does that no affect your data results
</div>

### Procedure
The following is a general outline of the team's experimental setup. Refer to Figure 1 for images and locations of the stated equipment.

1. The water pump is used to vary the velocity of influent stream through the flocculator,and therefore varies G in a controlled manner.
2. The clay pump contaminates clean water with a well-mixed clay solution.  The pump and influent turbidimeter together used PID control to maintain a constant influent turbidity of 100 NTU.
3. The PaCl coagulant pump introduces PaCl coagulant to the well-mixed clay-water solution. The clay-water solution enters the flocculator where clay particles collide and aggregate to form large flocs.
4. To account for the difference in flow between the water pump and the  effluent pump, a wastestream between the flocculator and sedimentation tube is introduced to maintain a constant up
flow velocity through the sedimentation tube. The sedimentation tube is an apparatus that is intended to mimic the function of a sedimentation tank in a full-scale treatment plant.
5. The flocs enter the bottom of the tube settler. The larger and denser particles settle out and are carried out to the waste stream.
6. The treated water, passing through the tube settler, exits the top and enters the effluent turbidimeter and are subsequently  carried out through the waste stream.
7. The waste pump acts to ensure that settled flocs in the tube settler exit the system without clogging the tubes.
8. The effluent pump ensures that the upflow velocity within the tube settler is kept at 2 mm/s, as recommended by the High Rate Sedimentation subteam.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
What is the function of the effluent pump?

This is less of a procedure and more of a description - I recommend relabeling this section as it is valuable to overall understanding and then write new procedures. Procedures should be the steps on how to use your apparatus.

## Results and Analysis

When conducting the experiment comparing the headloss in identical experiments with solely changing the tubing from regular (non-hydrophobic) tubing to hydrophobic tubing, the trial yield achieved the following results (Figure 6 & 7).

![nonhydrophobic](https://github.com/AguaClara/high_g_flocculation/blob/master/Full%20test,%20Regular%20tubing.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 6: Graph of Headloss vs. Time for Regular Tubing**

 ![hydrophobic](https://github.com/AguaClara/high_g_flocculation/blob/master/Full%20test,%20hydrophobic%20tubing.PNG?raw=true)
 **Figure 7: Graph of Headloss vs. Time for Hydrophobic Tubing**

The results showed an insignificant difference in headloss reduction. In both experiments, the trial started at around 70cm and after 10 hours reached 120cm at a constant rate. This showed that the hydrophobic tubing was ineffective at minimizing headloss due to the coagulant.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Any statistical reasoning behind the "insignificant difference"?

Good conclusion, but this experiment was not described enough in the method section to fully understand what was done to get here. Need to detail what data was collected
</div>

In order to determine the cause of pressure build-up, trials were conducted testing individual components. First, the team tested just water to ensure that the pressure did not increase naturally throughout the length of the experiment. The results of the trial are illustrated in Figure 8 below.

![just water](https://github.com/AguaClara/high_g_flocculation/blob/master/water%20only.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 8: Graph of Headloss vs. Time, Regular Tubing, Just Water Trial**

This experiment eliminated the possibility that the pressure build up was caused simply due to the actual set up of this experiment. This was consistent with the hypothesis, and the observation that whenever a new trial was ran, the pressure difference started at the same value every time. However, the team did see a small increase in pressure. This minor change in pressure could perhaps be attributed to changes in viscosity due to temperature changes throughout the day, but does not explain the majority of the increase in pressure. For the following experimental trials, the team wanted to observe how headloss behaved when adding coagulant into the system.

![water+coagulant,regtub](https://github.com/AguaClara/high_g_flocculation/blob/master/Water%20+%20Coag,%20Regular%20Tubing.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 9: Graph of Headloss vs. Time, Regular Tubing, Water & Coagulant Trial**

Due to the computer restarting overnight, ProCoDA only recorded 3 hours of data for this trial. Nonetheless, the results were unexpected compared to what was hypothesized. The team's initial belief was that the combination of the coagulant with the clay was the primary cause of the headloss. Instead, this data (Figure 9) shows that the coagulant alone caused a significant pressure increase. In fact, the pressure increase was even more significant. Within 3 hours, the pressure was able to rise from 70cm to 95cm, which is half the change when run with clay in a third of the time. To ensure the hydrophobic tubing makes an insignificant difference in headloss, the same experiment was ran again with hydrophobic tubing.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Unpack the following sentence - hard to digest: "Within 3 hours, the pressure was able to rise from 70cm to 95cm, which is half the change when run with clay in a third of the time."

Also why run it again with hydrophobic testing if you already ruled that out? Were you not confident in those results?
</div>

![water+coagulant,hydtub](https://github.com/AguaClara/high_g_flocculation/blob/master/Water%20+%20Coag,%20Hydrophobic%20Tubing.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 10: Graph of Headloss vs. Time, Hydrophobic Tubing, Water & Coagulant Trial**

Figure 10 depicts a continuous build-up of pressure. Comparing only the first 3 hours, there is a noticeable difference between the two (Figures 11 & 12). The headloss increase with hydrophobic tubing was almost half the change with regular tubing (15cm versus 25cm).

![water+coagulant,regtub3](https://github.com/AguaClara/high_g_flocculation/blob/master/Water%20+%20Coag,%20Regular%20Tubing.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 11: Graph of Headloss vs. Time, Regular Tubing, Water & Coagulant, 3-Hr Trial**

 **Figure 12: Graph of Headloss vs. Time, Hydrophobic Tubing, Water & Coagulant, 3-Hr Trial**

Another observation from this trial is the sudden drop in pressure around the hour 12 (Figure 10)- when the coagulant ran out. This potentially proves that running water for a short amount of time without coagulant can clear out the coagulant. A more focused graph at the 12th hour (Figure 13) shows a lost of almost all of the built up pressure within 2 minutes. This loss in pressure could be due to the pumping in of air bubbles as the coagulant pump continued to run. The team aims to analyze this further through future experimental trials.

![pressuredrop](https://github.com/AguaClara/high_g_flocculation/blob/master/pressuredrop.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 13: Refined View of 12th-Hr Pressure Drop, Hydrophobic Tubing, Water & Coagulant Trial**


## Conclusions
From comparing trials using Hydrophobic and Non-Hydrophobic tubing, there was no noticeable difference in pressure increase. Hydrophobic tubing is not effective in our experiments in preventing pressure increase, so research teams will be advised to continue using Non-Hydrophobic tubing. Nonetheless, the High G Flocculation team aims to conduct further experiments using hydrophobic tubing has recent trials have indicated that hydrophobic tubing may be useful in mitigating pressure buildup. However, priority will be given to experimental trials using regular tubing.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Above paragraph seems to contradict yourself. Didn't the first set of trials with just water indicate that the tubing type did NOT affect pressure, but then the coagulant trials imply that it does have an effect on pressure?

In this issue resolved? Is there another variable that hasn't been taken into account?

How can you recommend that teams not use hydropobic tubing, but still need to test more? Resolve these thoughts
</div>

By measuring the pressure increase in the flocculator in separate trials measuring only water, water and coagulant, and water, clay and coagulant, the team was able to isolate coagulant as the main contributor of pressure increase in the flocculator.  Future experiments will focused on reducing coagulant build up in the flocculator in order to lower the amount of pressure increase.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Did you do water, clay, and coagulant tests? You don't present any results from them, so this may be misleading

Connect back to why we need to lower the pressure! Get big picture again and discuss ramifications on a large scale of these conclusions.
</div>

## Future Work
Although the initial experimental trials with hydrophobic tubing indicated that it was not a viable solution to pressure build-up, the recent experiments (with just water & coagulant) indicate that it may be insightful to conduct additional experiments with hydrophobic tubing.
The specific experimental trials the team plans to conduct for the remainder of the semester are as follows:
1. Evaluate whether headloss can be mitigated by running the water pump at full speed for a short time (approx.30 seconds).
2. Determine an optimal G value by running trials at G values lower than 100 Hz.
3. Conduct experiments to determine a relationship between coagulant dose and optimal G through varied coagulant dose trials.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Notes on future trials:

1. Do you mean like run it with water & coagulant and then switch mid trial to see affect of lack of coagulant?
2. How will you know what the optimal G value will be - this experiment should be described in methods including how you will analyze the data and make conclusions

# Manual

## Fabrication Details
The majority of the High G Flocculation experimental apparatus consists of pre-manufactured equipment (pumps, stock tanks, turbidimeters, and pressure sensor). The sedimentation tube settler is fabricated by the High Rate Sedimentation subteam. The hydraulic flocculators are fabricated by the High G Flocculation team. The flocculators are assembled by wrapping the desired tubing (hydrophobic or regular) around a hollow, cylindrical piece of cardboard.  The flocculator is then mounted on to the experimental apparatus on adjustable metal hose clamps.


## Special Components
As a possible solution to pressure build up, this semester the team invested in fabricating a hydraulic flocculator using hydrophobic tubing. The initial experimental trials indicate that hydrophobic tubing produced an insignificant mitigation to headloss. Figure 14, below, summarizes the general technical specifications, pricing, and vendor information for both hydrophobic and regular tubing.

## Experimental Checklist
**(Including Pre-Experiment Cleaning)**

The following is a general outline of tasks to be done prior, during, and after experimentation.

1. Drain the sedimentation tank and flocculator from previous experimental trial, if necessary.
2. Refill clay and coagulant stock tanks.
3. Run tap water through the system to rinse the flocculator, sedimentation tank, and connecting piping.
4. Rinse and refill turbidimeters.
5. Use Python coagulant dosing calculation to determine the required coagulant pump speed for the desired coagulant dosage.
6. Check all valves and connections to make sure desired pathways are clear and undesired pathways are blocked.
7. Verify all influent, effluent and coagulant pumps are set to desired experimental flow rates.
8. Turn on influent pump to fill sedimentation tank with clean water.
9. Plug in clay stock stirrer if not already plugged in.
10. Turn on influent, effluent, and coagulant  pumps.
11. Set state to PID control in ProCoDA (this will turn on clay pump and also turn on data collection).

## ProCoDA Method File
Use this section to explain your method file. This could be broken up into several components as shown below:

Why is this blank? In the future if you don't have content for something, write "The ProCoDA method file is still in development" but it seems like there should be something here if you have run trials and collected data.

### States
Here, you should describe the function of each state in your method file, both in terms of its overall purpose and also in terms of the details that make it distinct from other states. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.
\end{itemize}



### Set Points
Here, you should list the set points used in your method file and explain their use as well as how each was calculated.



| Set Point | Setting     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Turb Target      | 100       |
| P  |  68 |
| i    | 125  |
| D   | 0  |
| Influent Turbidty ID  | 1  |
| Effluent Turbidity ID | 2  |

The table above shows the set points used in ProCoda to control the clay pump. The values of P, i, D were calibrated using this guide https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Calibrating+PID+Control. The Turb Target is set at 100 NTU for all experiments.

All other pumps were controlled manually. The pump before the flocculator has been set at 170 rpm for a G value of 113 Hz, and the pump after the sedimentation tank has been set at 60 rpm to maintain a 2 mm/s upflow velocity through the sedimentation tank.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Why 100 NTU for turbidity - explicitly state if this is just a convention for this series of experiments and why you can make that assumption.
